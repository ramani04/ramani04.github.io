DIGITAL BLOOD DONOR DATA:-
When a patient needs blood, he/she has to contact a blood bank or a compatible blood group of donor in their circle, family and friends.However, it is difficult to find suitable donor within a limited group of people in a given time. Finding a blood donor is a challenging issue in almost every country.
To overcome this problem we came with this digital blood donor data.
DIGITAL PLASMA DONOR DATA:-
This is specially created for those who are suffering from covid-19.
In plasma therapy , the antibody rich plasma from a covid recovered patient is extracted and administered to a patient. Plasma is collected from the patients after two weeks of their recovery from the virus.
=>Each plasma donation would be used to treat 2 patients.
=>In plasma donation ,as opposed to blood donation, only plasma is extracted and the other components of blood are returned to the body.
So,the people who recovered from covid-19 can come forward register here which helps in the recovery of other covid patients.
DEPLOYMENT:-
It is a well developed website through which a donor registers through  details such as mail,contact details,location,age,weight,past and present health status.
